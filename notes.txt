future optimizations:
 + Image#corner can memorized after first call
 + Reader#merge can return once error threshold 
   is passed instead of calculating to the end
 + The chars in the reader can be sorted by size 
   so that the first to hit good accuracy would be
   the biggest correct one as well
 + If nothing else helps we could split the text
   to chars again instead of to words and do simple
   char matching where we don't see multichars. That
   would break recongizing chars like double quotes 
   but can be fixed with simple lambda executed on
   the result text after reading. It could be defined
   in lang.yaml for consistency
